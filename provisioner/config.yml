    [bold green]NOTE[/]: You will need to tweak the rootfs parameter for openEuler to properly
    boot on Milk-V Pioneer v1.2 and later models, whose rootfs resides on NVMe
    drive instead of TF card.

    Since [yellow]ruyi[/] does not run as [yellow]root[/], you will have to perform the following
    actions yourself before booting the target device:

    * mount the target device's [green]/boot[/] partition,
    * check the file [cyan]/extlinux/extlinux.conf[/] in the partition,
    * replace [yellow]mmcblk1p3[/] with [yellow]nvme0n1p3[/] as needed.

    further instructions on image usage.
