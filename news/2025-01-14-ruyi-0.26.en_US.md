# Release notes for RuyiSDK 0.26

RuyiSDK 0.26 is now released. The corresponding package manager version is also 0.26.0.
You can download the RuyiSDK package manager from one of the following locations:

* https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/tag/0.26.0
* https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/0.26.0/

This update mainly consists of the following changes. Happy hacking!

## RuyiSDK Package Manager

* Added a `--verbose` (`-v`) option to `ruyi telemetry status`, allowing users to continue viewing their telemetry data upload plans after running `ruyi telemetry consent`.
* Fixed an issue where the toolchain `-mcpu` value might not be correctly mapped when creating a virtual environment using a vendor toolchain. If you are affected, please recreate your virtual environment after running `ruyi update`.
* Continued work on platform compatibility guarantees:
    * Added a platform compatibility technical document that clarifies the baseline versions of third-party dependencies currently supported by `ruyi`.
    * Ensured via CI that all changes to `ruyi` do not affect `ruyi` passing the test suite on Ubuntu 22.04.
* Engineering changes:
    * Fixed an issue where a layer of subdirectory structure was missing in the source package.
    * Updated Poetry to version 2.0, along with updating the Python project metadata (`pyproject.toml`) for `ruyi`.

## RuyiSDK Software Repository

* Updated `board-image/revyos-sipeed-lpi4a`.
* Supported the new profile API to work with `ruyi` 0.26.0 changes, ensuring correct `-mcpu` configuration for virtual environments.
