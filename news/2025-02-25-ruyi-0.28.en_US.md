# Release notes for RuyiSDK 0.28

RuyiSDK 0.28 is now released. The corresponding package manager version is also 0.28.0.
You can download the RuyiSDK package manager from one of the following locations:

* https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/tag/0.28.0
* https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/0.28.0/

This update mainly consists of the following changes. Happy hacking!

## RuyiSDK Package Manager

* When running commands that do not rely on repository data, the repository will no longer be pulled if it is not yet locally present.
* `ruyi list` now supports basic filtering queries: use `--category-is` to query packages under a specific category, and use `--name-contains` to query packages whose names contain specific text.
* `ruyi list` without any parameters is no longer supported due to the ever-increasing number of packages. If you have scripts that rely on the previous behavior, please modify them according to the prompts.

## RuyiSDK Software Repository

* Added the following packages:
    * `source/wiringx`: Official source code for the wiringX project. wiringX is a modular GPIO support component.
* Updated the following packages:
    * `board-image/bianbu-bpi-f3`
    * `board-image/revyos-milkv-meles`
    * `board-image/revyos-sg2042-milkv-pioneer`
* Fixed the file type marker for the `boot` partition of `board-image/revyos-milkv-meles`.
