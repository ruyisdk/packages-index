# Release notes for RuyiSDK 0.44

RuyiSDK 0.44 is now released. The corresponding package manager version is also 0.44.0.
You can download the RuyiSDK package manager from one of the following locations:

* [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ruyi/0.44.0/): `pip install ruyi`
* <https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/tag/0.44.0>
* <https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/0.44.0/>

> [!NOTE]
> RISC-V users can install `ruyi` using `pip`, but since some Python libraries
> depended on by `ruyi` do not yet provide pre-compiled packages for the RISC-V
> architecture on PyPI, the Python package manager will attempt to compile and
> install these dependencies from source code when installing `ruyi`, which may
> be very time-consuming or fail to compile.
>
> If you encounter problems installing `ruyi` on a RISC-V device, it is recommended
> to use other installation methods.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note: [It is known][ruyi-pipx] that installing `ruyi` with `pipx` will
> cause subsequently created Ruyi virtual environments to be unusable. This will
> be fixed in the next version. Until then, please do not use `pipx` to install
> `ruyi`.

This update mainly consists of the following changes. Happy hacking!

## RuyiSDK Package Manager

* Telemetry changes:
    * Fixed the issue where proactive `ruyi telemetry upload` would not work
      when telemetry mode is `local`.
    * For RuyiSDK operational needs, if your telemetry mode is `on` and the
      last upload was at least 7 days ago, `ruyi` will upload telemetry data on
      your next invocation, regardless of the scheduled upload day.
    * For RuyiSDK operational needs, if you chose to disable data collection
      and upload on first run, `ruyi` will still perform one upload containing
      an unsaved random ID and the current `ruyi` version.
      If you do not wish for this upload to happen, please ensure
      `RUYI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1` is set before using `ruyi`.

For low-frequency users of `ruyi`, this update may allow the RuyiSDK team to
observe more specific behavior patterns regarding your installation ID than
before. The RuyiSDK team has not conducted any such data mining so far.

## RuyiSDK Software Repository

* New device support:
    * Milk-V Megrez: Compatible with various Bianbu images. Thanks to [@weilinfox] for the contribution!
* Improved device support:
    * Renamed the `manual` profile for RV32 (for manual management of compilation flags) to `manual-rv32` to avoid conflict with the RV64 profile of the same name. Thanks to [@Cyl18] for [reporting][issue149]!
