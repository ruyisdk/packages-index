# RuyiSDK now supports displaying news

We have added support for news items to `ruyi` for you to follow
RuyiSDK development more easily.

If you are on ruyi 0.3 or greater, any incoming news item will appear
after a successful `ruyi update`. You can list all news items with
`ruyi news list`, and read with `ruyi news read`.

Thank you for supporting RuyiSDK!
