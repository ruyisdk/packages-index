# Release notes for RuyiSDK 0.4

RuyiSDK 0.4 is now released. The corresponding package manager version is also 0.4.
You can download the RuyiSDK package manager from the GitHub Releases page:
https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases .

This update mainly consists of the following changes. Happy hacking!

## RuyiSDK Package Manager

* `ruyi device provision` now wraps invocations of `fastboot` with `sudo`.
* `ruyi self uninstall --purge` now does not forget to remove the
  `~/.local/state/ruyi` directory.
* Some hints are now provided when `ruyi` fails to download from the repo,
  for aiding the user's troubleshooting.
* The RuyiSDK software repository is now migrated to GitHub for stability of
  service. You may have to take additional measures to continue syncing if
  your region/organization have network access restrictions in place.

The repo at the original location will stop being regularly updated from
2024-02-01 on. Please upgrade your `ruyi` installation as soon as possible
to automatically migrate to the latest configuration defaults.

## RuyiSDK Software Repository

* Added the DynamoRIO suite `analyzer/dynamorio-riscv` for RISC-V hosts.
* Added system-level QEMU package `emulator/qemu-system-riscv-upstream` for AMD64 hosts.
* The upstream QEMU build is now bumped to 8.2.0.
